- SIMPLY PUT, MEAL PREP is the act of preparing and storing in advance several individual servings of one or more weekly meals and snacks. Although meal planning is involved, meal prep takes the selection and scheduling of meals a step further by actually having them fully cooked and boxed. Meal prepping can be done one or two days each week, depending on your individual needs and schedule. The same meal will be divided and boxed for several ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F7HX1HR&location=136))

- MEAL PREP DOS AND DON’TS Developing smart meal prepping habits is part of the learning process. Here are some meal prep dos and don’ts worth keeping in mind as you get started: ✔DO flag healthy recipes you love. After trying healthy recipes, keep the ones you love in a folder or mark them in the cookbook. ✔DO go at your own pace. You can successfully meal prep with three recipes or six recipes. You don’t need to prepare 10 or more recipes for the week. Start slowly and build your way up. ✔DO work with your schedule. Some weeks you’ll be able to prepare more recipes than other weeks. Do whatever works for you and your schedule. ✔DO freeze extras. Some weeks you will have a few extra meals. Freezer-friendly meals can be frozen and kept for up to a few months, as noted in the recipes. ✔DO make cleanup easy. You’ll have many vegetable scraps, eggshells, and empty containers to toss, so keep your recycling, compost bin, and trash nearby for easy cleanup. ✘DON’T leave everything until the last minute. Plan ahead for best results. Meal prepping is about scheduling your time in advance, so you can get to the market and buy the ingredients you need, then spend the necessary time at home preparing them. ✘DON’T divide meals later. The last step of meal prepping is to divide recipes into individual portions and pack them into containers. Don’t skip this step or divide meals right before digging into one. Dividing meals up front helps maintain good portion control, prevents last-minute scrambling to divide meals, and ensures your meals will last through the week. ✘DON’T overprep. The last thing you want to do is prep meals that will go uneaten, unless of course you can freeze them. To get into the meal prepping jive, start slow and get to know your meal prepping needs.

- GO FOOD SHOPPING ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F7HX1HR&location=214))
- List the ingredients you need to purchase according to the flow of your market. For example, if you shop at a traditional supermarket, produce is usually the first place you’ll find yourself. I typically categorize my shopping list in this order: fruits, vegetables and herbs, milk and dairy, proteins (like meat, chicken, and fish), packaged goods, and frozen items. Note how much you need of each ingredient to avoid buying too much. But don’t worry about this straight away. For this book’s meal preps, the shopping lists specify the amount of each ingredient you’ll need. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F7HX1HR&location=215))
- The following are my go-to ingredients that I use in this cookbook: Vegetables •Asparagus •Broccoli •Carrots •Cauliflower •Celery •Onions •Portobello mushrooms •Russet potatoes •Spinach •Sweet potatoes •Tomatoes •Zucchini Lean Protein •Beans (black, pinto) •Chicken breast, skinless, boneless •Eggs •Ground beef (at least 90% lean) •Lentils •Nuts (cashews, almonds, pecans) •Peanut butter •Salmon Whole Grains •Brown rice •Farro •Oats •Quinoa •Sorghum •Whole-grain pasta •Whole-wheat couscous Fruits •Bananas •Berries (strawberries, blueberries) •Melon •Pineapple Dairy •Milk, nonfat or low-fat (1%) •Mozzarella cheese, part-skim •Parmesan cheese, grated •Yogurt, Greek, nonfat plain and vanilla Healthy Fats •Canola oil •Olive oil •Nonstick cooking oil spray ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F7HX1HR&location=228))
- PREP AND COOK ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F7HX1HR&location=256))
- In general, this is a good rule of thumb for meal prep order: •Always start with the slow cooker recipe (if applicable). •Prep ingredients, such as vegetables and proteins, for recipes that take longer to cook, so you can get those recipes started. •Prep sauces and dressings that may be needed. For example, if the chicken needs to be marinated (which takes at least 30 minutes), prepare the marinade earlier in your meal prep day so you can start marinating right away. •Begin longer-cooking recipes, especially recipes that will be baked or roasted in the oven or stove top for over 20 minutes. Once these dishes are cooking, you can continue prepping other recipes. •Prep nuts and fruit. •Leave shorter recipes for downtimes. Easy no-cook recipes (like To-Go Peanut Butter–Veggie Jars) can be prepared when you’re waiting for a recipe to finish cooking in the oven or simmering on the stove top. •Cook the remaining recipes, which should be easier since you’ve already prepped most of the ingredients. •Portion and pack meals and snacks into single-serve containers. Stack in your refrigerator or pantry (if applicable) so they’re grab-and-go-ready. Extra meals that are freezer-friendly can be frozen ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F7HX1HR&location=258))
- PORTION AND PACK ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F7HX1HR&location=271))
- The exact portions (or serving size) for each meal are listed within each recipe. Meals can be packed in several different types of containers (see here). ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F7HX1HR&location=272))
- a rule of thumb, your meal should consist of this combination: •one-quarter lean protein (typically 3 to 4 ounces of fish, chicken, pork, or beef) or a vegetarian protein source (such as tofu, eggs, beans, or lentils) •one-quarter whole grains (about ¾ to 1 cup) •one-half vegetables or fruit (about 1 cup) ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07F7HX1HR&location=274))
