- Champlain traveled in other circles among the leaders of Indian nations, who also were great dreamers. He knew them intimately, and they live as individuals in the pages of his books. Champlain had a way of getting along with very different people, and he also had the rarest gift of all. In long years of labor, he found a way to convert his dreams into realities. In the face of great obstacles and heavy defeats, he exercised his skills of leadership in extreme conditions. Those of us who are leaders today (which includes most of us in an open society) have something to learn from him about that. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=255))
- Champlain was a leader, but he was not a saint. We do not need another work of hagiography about him. He was a mortal man of flesh and blood, a very complicated man. He made horrific errors in his career, and some of his mistakes cost other men their lives. He cultivated an easy manner, but sometimes he drove his men so hard that four of them tried to murder him. His quest for amity and concord with the Indians led to wars with the Mohawk and the Onondaga. His private life was deeply troubled, particularly in his relations with women. Champlain lived comfortably as a man among men, but one discovery eluded this great discoverer. He never found the way to a woman’s heart. It was not for want of trying. He was strongly attracted to women, but his most extended relationship ended in frustration. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=260))
- His ideal of humanity was very large, but it was also limited in strange, ironic ways. Champlain embraced the American Indians, but not his own French servants. He had deep flaws and made many enemies, responded badly to criticism, and could be very petty to rivals. But other men who knew this man wrote of him with respect and affection. Even his enemies did so. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=265))
- In this recent work, old methods are being used in new ways. One of them is the method of Herodotus, and his idea of history as a genuinely free and open inquiry—the literal Greek meaning of history. Another way forward was the school that taught historians three lessons about their work: “First, go there! Do it! Then write it!” To read Champlain’s many books in that spirit, to explore the places that he described, and to follow in his track, is to make an astonishing discovery about our own world. Many of the places that Champlain described in the seventeenth century can still be seen today, not precisely as he saw them, but some of them are remarkably little changed. This is so in large parts of the St. Lawrence Valley and the magnificent Saguenay River. It is so along the Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Maine, the forests and waterways of Canada, the harbors of Acadia, and the coast of Gaspésie. It is so in the United States on Mount Desert Island, the Isles Rangées, the Puffin Islands, and Ticonderoga. It is that way again in the rolling ground of the Onondaga Country, and the natural meadowlands of Cap Tourmente.

- This inquiry is conceived in that spirit. It begins not with a thesis, or a theory, or an ideology, but with a set of open questions about Champlain. It asks, who was this man? Where did he come from? What did he do? Why did he do it? What difference did he make? Why should we care? The answers to all these questions make a story.

- He learned about fidelity to comrades, obedience to superiors, responsibility for others, loyalty to a cause, and endurance in a long struggle. That experience taught him to master himself, which was the first step in learning to lead others. He also learned the importance of strength, stamina, and steadfast purpose. A good captain, he wrote, “must be hardy and active,” and “untiring at his work.”17 Most of all he learned about courage, honor, and duty.

- and Spitz-bergen.38 The king ([Location 1343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=1343))
- Among them were efforts by Jacques Cartier in Canada (1534–43), Jean Ribault and René Goulaine de Laudonnière in Florida (1562–67), the marquis de la Roche on Sable Island (1597–1602), and Pierre de Chauvin at Tadoussac (1599–1600). Each of them taught Champlain a lesson about how not to found a colony. ([Location 2018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=2018))
- First was the necessity of detailed planning. In the ventures that failed he found too little serious preparation, “too much table talk,” and too many fantastic schemes. “Filling the mind with illusions,” ([Location 2110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=2110))
- A second lesson was the importance of careful exploration before settlement. He wrote, “it is of little use to run to distant lands and go to inhabit them, without first exploring them and living there at least an entire year, to learn about the quality of the land and the diversity of the seasons, in order afterward to lay the foundation of a colony.” Champlain observed, “Most colonizers and travellers do not do this, and are content to see the coasts and the elevations of the lands in passing, without staying there.” He believed that only the evidence of first-hand experience could be trusted. In particular, it is a common mistake “to believe that everything follows the rule that exists in the latitude of the places where they live, and it is in this that they find themselves greatly mistaken.”44 ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=2113))
- A third lesson was about order and authority. These many French disasters persuaded Champlain that a successful colony must have unity and strict discipline. ([Location 2119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=2119))
- Other presents included a baby moose (six months old and already “as big as a horse”), a caribou (the first recorded use of that word), a muskrat (rat musqué, they called it), a huge set of moose antlers, a living hummingbird, a collection of dead birds, plus bows and arrows, Indian portraits, and other marvels for the royal collection.6 ([Location 3493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=3493))
- His elaborate efforts to broaden the base of his American project were shaped by the structure of power in France. By comparison with the empire of New Spain, French colonies in America began as experiments in mixed enterprise. ([Location 5009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5009))
- To help with that task Champlain recruited more young men for his “corps of interpreters,” both Indians and Europeans. One of them was a Huron named Savignon, who had spent a year in France. Another was a Frenchman named Nicolas de Vignau, who had been sent to live among the northern Indians.2 ([Location 5028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5028))
- While working with his investors, Champlain somehow found the time to finish another book called Les voyages du Sieur de Champlain, Xaintongeois, capitaine ordinaire pour le Roy, en la marine. It bore the date of 1613 and was published by Jean Berjon, at the sign of the Flying Horse on the rue St. Jean de Beauvais in Paris. ([Location 5368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5368))
- He also published three larger maps of New France. One of them was called a “Carte Géographique de la Nouvelle France (1612),” a long narrow map that centered on the St. Lawrence Valley. ([Location 5373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5373))
- He also saw a newly published work called Tabula Nautica by Hessel Gerritsz, which showed the explorations of Henry Hudson in northern waters and Hudson Bay. ([Location 5382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5382))
- In 1615, Champlain brought four Récollet missionaries to New France. They were followed by Gabriel Sagard, who lived among the Huron (1623–24) and published his Long Voyage to the Land of the Hurons in 1632. ([Location 5507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5507))
- His Histoire du Canada (1635) includes Huron sheet music and more details of Champlain’s life. ([Location 5510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5510))
- In Champlain’s thinking, the many good qualities of American Indians were countered by three great negatives: ni foi, ni loi, ni roi; no faith, no law, no king. ([Location 5856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5856))
- “It is a great misfortune that so many poor creatures should live and die without any knowledge of God, and even without any religion or law, whether divine, political or civil.”72 ([Location 5861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5861))
- He understood their custom as lex talionis, the law of retaliation, which punished one wrong by the commission of another. ([Location 5869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5869))
- regarded the ethics of Indian culture as primitive and inhumane. The leading example was the treatment of prisoners, who were condemned to suffer unimaginably in horrible rituals of sadistic savagery. ([Location 5872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5872))
- Champlain also believed that the culture of North American Indians lacked the authority of kingship and the discipline of subordination. ([Location 5876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5876))
- He also disapproved of the way Indian warriors treated women and compelled them to “serve as mules.” And “as to the men,” he wrote, “they do nothing but hunt deer and other animals, fish, build lodges and go on the war path. Having done this, they visit other nations to trade and exchange, and on their return do not cease from feasting and dancing, with which they entertain one another, and afterwards they go to sleep, which is their finest exertion.”77 ([Location 5880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5880))
- In the late twentieth century, some ethnographers have severely chastised Champlain for these attitudes. They have criticized him for being uncomprehending of Indian culture, and ethnocentric in his judgments. It is true that Champlain had a strong and abiding Christian faith, a deep belief in an idea of law as the rule of universal right, and an allegiance to kingship and subordination. At the same time, he was deeply interested in the ways of the Indians, lived with them for long periods, traveled with them, and fought beside them in three campaigns. He knew intimately the Etchemin and Mi’kmaq, Montagnais and Algonquin, Huron, and many other Indian nations. He understood their complex politics and their way of war. There were limits to his understanding. He was not fluent in Indian languages and worked through interpreters on important occasions, though he could communicate directly in pidgin speech, as he often did. His understanding of Indian groups was incomplete and sometimes erroneous. But he deeply respected the Indians, admired their character, and wrote that “their spirit was not as savage as their customs.” ([Location 5884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=5884))
- Champlain made frequent reference to what had been done and could be done “for the Glory of God” and “the honor of His Majesty.” He made an argument with changes in emphasis that reflected the king’s interests. The first purpose was the establishment of Christianity “among an infinite number of souls.” The second was for the king to become “master and lord of a country nearly 1,800 leagues in length,” and he described its beauty and abundance in lyrical terms.37 A third purpose was to find a passage to China and the East Indies by way of the St. Lawrence, which he had already ascended to a distance of more than four hundred leagues, and beyond that was a great lake more than three hundred leagues in length. He observed that the king could derive a great and notable profit from the “taxes and duties on merchandise from China and the East Indies—I value more than ten times greater than all those levied in France.38 ([Location 6148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=6148))

- Between 1620 and 1624, he also sent more young men to live among the Indians. Nicolas Marsolet went to the Montagnais in the Saguenay country; young Jean Nicollet and Jean Richer lived among the Nipissing. Brûlé and Du Vernay worked in Huronia, and Olivier Le Tardif dwelled among the Algonquin, to mention only a few. At one feast alone, the Algonquin nations of the upper St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers agreed to take eleven Frenchmen, each with his own Indian minder.48 ([Location 6643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=6643))
- One of Ventadour’s first acts as viceroy was to confirm Champlain as his chief lieutenant in New France, with a commission dated February 15, 1625. In doing so he followed every previous viceroy and general of New France since 1604. The sieur de Mons, the comte de Soissons, the prince of Condé, the marquis de Thémines, and the duc de Montmorency all had chosen Champlain as their lieutenant and had come to think of him as their indispensable man in New France.26 ([Location 6872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=6872))
- The most urgent problem was that of the commercial companies. There were now two of them.30 One was the old Company of Rouen and Saint-Malo. The other was the new Company de Caën, based in Dieppe, Paris, and Orleans. Only a few men (Ézechiel de Caën for one) belonged to both. The two groups differed in their origins but shared the same interest in extracting quick profits from a monopoly of the fur trade. Neither was happy with Champlain’s relentless effort to expand permanent settlements at their expense. Some leaders complained that the colonizing effort was doomed to fail. Others feared that it might succeed and that colonists would become competitors. Several ([Location 6886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=6886))
- He wrote his biggest and most important book, called Voyages de la Nouvelle France, and published it in 1632. ([Location 7645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=7645))
- In 1632, Champlain also published a map of New France which many cartographers recognize as his best. It had a different character and purpose from the work he had done before. ([Location 7665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=7665))
- This work was a map rather than a chart, centering more on the land than the sea. ([Location 7675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=7675))
- The primary object of the map was to display the integrity and unity of New France. ([Location 7680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=7680))
- This was his twenty-seventh Atlantic crossing, and Champlain was the most experienced navigator in the fleet. ([Location 7888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=7888))
- It was an amazing sight. Le Jeune was an eyewitness, and he reported: “I could scarcely tell you how the people of this nation wear their hair. Each follows his own fancy. Some wear it long and hanging over to one side like women, and short and tied up on the other, so skillfully that one ear is concealed and the other uncovered. Some of them are shaven just where others wear a long moustache. I have seen some who have a large strip, closely shaved, extended across the head, passing from the crown to the middle of the forehead. Others wear in the same place a sort of queue which stands out because they have shaved all around it.”37 ([Location 8093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=8093))
- For both men, this was the hardest part of their task and the most vital to the peopling of a colony. French families showed great reluctance to emigrate, unlike those from Britain, Germany, and other European countries. The anomaly of French attitudes toward emigration has never been explained. ([Location 8502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=8502))
- At the same time, he and Indian leaders sent their youths to France on similar errands. He called these young people “truchements,” or interpreters. It was an exotic word in French, borrowed from the Turkish tergiman and Arabic targuman on another cultural frontier, where Christians, Turks, and Arabs had met during the crusades. Champlain used the word in its literal meaning, but he thought of his truchements as more than merely translators. The interpreters were instructed to explore the country, live among Indian nations, master native languages, promote trade, build alliances, observe carefully, and report on what they saw.7 ([Location 8744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=8744))
    - Note: temp essai
- Even as Champlain set this process in motion, he was not entirely happy with its results. Some of these young people troubled him. In his words, more than a few of them began to “live licentiously and freely, after the English fashion,” in what he called la vie angloise. Others acquired complex loyalties, and Champlain believed that some had no loyalties at all. ([Location 8758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=8758))
- Brûlé (or Bruslé) was born around 1592, perhaps in Champignysur-Marne, southeast of Paris, where his brother was a wine producer. Probably he came to Quebec with Champlain in 1608, at the age of sixteen. He must have been an engaging youth—bright and lively, with extraordinary initiative. ([Location 8763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=8763))
- The nearest thing that Brûlé had to a home was Huronia, but now he was unwelcome there as well. Finally, in June, 1633, after much agonized discussion, the Huron were driven to a desperate measure. They killed him and then told Champlain what they had done. He is thought to have been the only Frenchman that the Huron ever killed.21 ([Location 8826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0031TZBH4&location=8826))
