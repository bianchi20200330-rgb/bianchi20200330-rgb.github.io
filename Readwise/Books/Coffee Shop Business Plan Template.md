- Lifestyle factors converge to make the coffee industry strong at all times. The stimulant effect of coffee is an important reason why many hard-working, fast-paced Americans consider a stop at their local coffeehouse a necessary part of their day. Conversely, coffeehouses provide calm, inviting environment for people to socialize, relax or catch up on work. Young people under the legal drinking age are one of the fastest-growing segments of the coffee drinking market. Coffeehouses provide them with a much-needed place to meet with their friends.

- Coffee drinking is now an all-day activity. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JPRU518&location=366))
- Even late at night, many coffeehouses are packed with patrons. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JPRU518&location=368))
