## Highlights
- By presenting your analytics professionally, you will be able to show advertisers why spending their advertising budgets on your blog will help them find their exact audience, answering any questions and addressing any concerns they may have about investing. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=162))
- Similarly, you can also have more than one analytics software running on your blog, giving you the ability to compare directly and see which works best for you. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=240))
- Whichever product you use, the important thing is usability. You will develop speed and efficiency as you go on. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=246))
- Google Analytics ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=252))
- Step 1 - Implement the analytics code Step 2 - Analyse the data Step 3 - Refine and present the data ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=284))
- Bounce Rate (i.e. those visitors who view only one page before leaving) is ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=291))
- Analysing also means thinking in terms of what opportunity your blog holds for potential advertisers. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=293))
- What is it they are looking for and how can you fulfil that need? ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=294))
- a tenancy ad (a fixed cost the advertiser pays to have their ad on the page, regardless of whether anyone clicks on it or not); a CPM (Cost per Mile) ad, where the advertiser pays to have their advert shown a pre-determined number of times, e.g. 10,000 impressions; a PPC (Pay per Click) ad where the advertiser pays only when people click on their ad; an affiliate scheme where you take a fixed percentage of any resulting sale made by a visitor (this is also sometimes known as a CPA (Cost per Acquisition)) or a CPV (Cost per View) ad where the advertiser pays you for anyone who views their video – whether the viewer takes action or not, you get paid if the video is viewed. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=298))
- Are you a content site? Do people come to you for your expertise on a particular subject? Are you trying to sell something through your site? If so, are you selling: Products? Services? Expertise? ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=344))
- ‘traffic’ ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=375))
- visitors – how many people came to your website in a given time period and pageviews – how many pages those visitors viewed over any given amount of time ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=376))
- Click Through Rate, otherwise known as CTR. You’re ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=388))
- The CTR is calculated as a percentage as follows: CTR = (banner ad clicks/impressions) x 100 For example, let’s say that 1 banner ad click occurred after 100 ad impressions were delivered. In this case, the CTR would be as follows: (1 click / 100 impressions) x 100 = 1% CTR ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=402))
- There are different methods to predict what your CTR may be: You could take an industry average. You could take an average for your particular sector/type of blog. You could use your own historical data which you’ll build up over a few months. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=423))
- The question you need to ask is what is 200 clicks to my advertiser worth? ([Location 433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=433))
- There are lots of ways you can establish this. One method is to calculate: The average purchase price of the product/service my advertiser is selling. The probability that the visitor will purchase through the advertiser’s site, i.e. the advertiser’s conversion rate. Let’s look at two examples of how this could work. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=434))
- A CPM (Cost per Mile) model, where you charge a fixed amount of money to deliver the ads. Note that we said ‘deliver’ – we are only guaranteeing ad delivery, not subsequent sales. Main pro: you will get paid regardless of whether anyone clicks on the ads or not. Main con: you may have to accept a lower rate, but at least you are guaranteed payment. A CPC (Cost Per Click) model, where you only get paid per click of the creative, essentially letting the advertiser have free advertising. Main pro: you can negotiate a higher rate per click. Main con: you may receive nothing, since if no one clicks, you don’t get paid. If you go for this model, be sure to have high confidence levels that visitors will click the adverts A CPA (Cost per Acquisition) model, where you only get paid if someone actually buys the product or goods on offer. Main pro: you can negotiate a really high rate for each acquisition made. In the example of the financial investment portfolio, your share of a single acquisition of a portfolio could be more than you would earn in a whole month using a CPM model. Main con: you could end up with nothing – you are essentially dependent upon how well the advertiser converts any traffic you send them (assuming anyone actually clicks on the ads in the first place). The worst-case scenario is that you end up giving away free advertising. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=453))
- These analytics will show the advertiser that you have exactly the audience they are after. When ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=472))
- In the next chapter we’ll explore further how you can dive into your analytics to determine what you can offer to your advertiser. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=480))
- Set milestone targets to help you understand how near (or far) you are to reaching your overall goal. Understand what strategy is best suited to your website as it currently stands. Assess the effectiveness of your marketing efforts. Identify what you need to change in your marketing mix to reach each milestone. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=486))
- If you have low traffic, the first metric to look at is the engagement level of your current audience. ‘Engagement’ essentially means: Are your visitors engaging with your content? Are they reading lots of your posts? How many posts do they read on average? How much time do they spend reading your posts? Do they leave comments at the end of your posts? Are they sharing your content on social media (Tweets, Likes, +1s are strong ‘social signals’)? Which part of the posts are they reading? If you have video, are they watching the video? Are they signing up to your latest financial asset newsletter? ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=497))
- SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) or marketing. But you can show ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=516))
- You can demonstrate engagement by creating a dashboard comprised of various metrics including: pages per visit duration on website average time spent on each page social shares comments ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=524))
- start with, you’d like to know: Who are the visitors coming to the site? Are they new visitors or are they returning visitors? How many of them bounce, i.e. look at one page and leave? How are they getting to your site in the first place? Where (i.e. geographical location) are they coming from? ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=545))
- But the problem is that bloggers are not delving deep enough into the analytics to understand and tell the whole story of their blog. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=580))
- How much money do I want to earn from my blog? How many visitors or pageviews do I need to generate on my blog to earn that amount of money? How do those visitors need to interact with my site? Do I need them to: Click on a banner ad? Leave their e-mail address? Fill out a form? Refer a friend? Download a product? Where can I find the audience that I need and what methods work best to bring them to my blog? What is it that this audience needs and what problem are they struggling with that I can solve? ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=597))
- This in itself is a major sign to the advertiser that your website: has visitors who are engaged in the content so much so that they are willing to load a second page to get answers to their questions; is providing solutions and could, together with the advertiser’s products, be part of the solution. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=613))
- You may run a parenting website like mine (www.workingParent.info), which includes a page to search for activities like playgroups in your area. The sort of thing where a visitor can enter their postcode (zip code) and a list of local playgroups appears. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=628))
- With this sort of page, you can show: how many people visit that page how many people enter their postcode what those postcodes are how many click on the result to go the playgroup details page ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=631))
- What is the main difference between pageviews, visitors and sessions? Which of these should I use? ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=669))
- A pageview, as the name suggests, is the number of times a page on your blog loads. A visitor is a person from a unique IP address surfing your site. A session is the period of time that visitor engages (surfs) with your site. ([Location 672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=672))
- You could have more than three ads on one page but I’d recommend not to. More than three ads on a page saturates your page with advertising and takes away from the content, plus there are other valuable goals that you can put in your sidebars, like acquiring Twitter/Facebook/Google+ followers, having people join your mailing list and so on. Currently, three ad units is the maximum that most ad exchange programmes allow for. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TOEHYA2&location=705))
- So should you go in with an introductory offer as it’s their first time advertising with you and your first time advertising with anyone (whether you tell them that or not is another decision to make)? The answer is to get some data behind you and base your figure on some real stats. I suggest once you hit your monthly target for pageviews (i.e. 5,000 or better yet 10,000 per month), start putting up advertising from an ad exchange platform like Google AdSense (others do exist and we’ll discuss in Chapter 27) and start measuring the impressions served and the click through rates these adverts deliver. In Chapter 29, I will show you how to ensure that you have context-sensitive ads appear using the settings in Google AdSense. From here you will have a base figure of impressions, clicks and most importantly how much revenue you make from Google AdSense.
