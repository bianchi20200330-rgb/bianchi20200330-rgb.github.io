## Highlights
- Reinhold Niebuhr ([Location 34](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=34))
- liberalism: how ‘a dogma which was intended to guarantee the economic freedom of the individual became the “ideology” of vast corporate structures of a later period of capitalism, used by them, and still used, to prevent a proper political control of their power’. ([Location 38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=38))
- the fundamentalist creed that has shaped our age – that Western-style capitalism and liberal democracy will be gradually generalised around the world, and every society, in short, ought to evolve just as Britain and the United States did. ([Location 40](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=40))
- The brutal realities of India’s military occupation of Kashmir and the blatant falsehoods and deceptions that accompanied it forced me to revisit many of the old critiques of Western imperialism and its rhetoric of progress. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=62))
- The centuries of civil war, imperial conquest, brutal exploitation and genocide were suppressed in accounts that showed how Westerners made the modern world, and became with their liberal democracies the superior people everyone else ought to catch up with. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=85))
- that the mainstream of Anglo-America in the early 2000s deferentially hosted figures like Niall Ferguson, and arguments that the occupation and subjugation of other people’s territory and culture were an efficacious instrument of civilisation, and that we needed more such emancipatory imperialism to bring intransigently backward peoples in line with the advanced West. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=91))
- Astonishingly, British imperialism, seen for decades by Western scholars and anti-colonial leaders alike as a racist, illegitimate and often predatory despotism, came to be repackaged in our own time as a benediction that, in Ferguson’s words, ‘undeniably pioneered free trade, free capital movements and, with the abolition of slavery, free labour’. ([Location 94](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=94))
- To give one example: In Free to Choose, a hugely influential book (and ten-part television series), Milton and Rose Friedman had posed a seductive binary of rational markets versus interfering governments (what came to underpin World Bank and International Monetary Fund reports, policies and prescriptions for the next two decades). ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=109))
- This fable about the East Asian ‘miracle’, then, became central to mainstream reporting about Asia. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=116))
- Non-Americans rose to senior positions in American-dominated international institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=135))
- American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute and the Peterson Institute ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=136))
- Jagdish Bhagwati, ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=140))
- Nevertheless, the maniacal cries of ‘Allahu Akbar’ were met by a louder drumbeat of ‘Western values’ and confidence-building invocations of the West’s apparent quintessence, such as the Enlightenment. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=155))
- Salman Rushdie ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=158))
- Susan Sontag ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=158))

- Martin Amis, ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=171))
- The fervour of the ideologue manqué made no room for the sober fact that almost every nation state harbours a disaffected and volatile minority, whose size varies constantly in inverse relation to the alertness, tact and wisdom of the majority population. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=180))
- Its terms had been set too low, and it came to be dominated by an isolated and vain chattering class that, all shook up by a changing world, sought to reassure themselves and us by digging an unbridgeable Maginot Line around our minds and hearts. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=187))
- Ardent young socio-economic engineers imported from America to Baghdad’s Green Zone tried to achieve everything in Iraq that the free-marketeers hoped for at home – the abolition of welfare, privatisation of the military and prisons, and general deregulation. This most audacious experiment yet in Americanisation not only provoked a ferocious insurgency; it triggered the break-up of the country, the rise of Islamic State and the unravelling of the Middle East. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=192))
- Donald Trump’s victory in November 2016 revealed, the Washington consensus had created too many victims in Washington, DC’s own hinterland. While the battle for democracy and capitalism raged in the Levant, they were being steadily undermined west of the Potomac by extreme concentrations of wealth, the steady criminalisation of the poor, dysfunctional politics, a rogue security establishment and a heedless media. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=199))
    - Note: Indifference
- The coronavirus cruelly exposed the reality they had long concealed: heavily indebted states, bailed-out corporations, impoverished working classes, and eviscerated public health systems. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=217))
- The world as we have known it, moulded by the beneficiaries of both Western imperialism and anti-imperialist nationalism, is crumbling. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=220))
- But, as the later essays in this collection point out, the newly emergent voices in the public sphere are still likely to be drowned out by loud and repetitive lamentations about the loss of Anglo-American poise and virtue. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=223))
- Gandhi, who saw democracy as literally the rule of the people, the demos, claimed that it was merely ‘nominal’ in the West. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y73Q2S3&location=237))

- Ferguson names six ‘killer apps’ – property rights, competition, science, medicine, the consumer society and the work ethic – as the operating software of Western civilisation that, beginning around 1500, enabled a few small polities at the western end of the Eurasian landmass ‘to dominate the rest of the world’.
