## Highlights
- Over the next 12 chapters, we aim to give you insight into some of the secrets of our success, how to build a brand, create a destination, and design an environment where the return you get from your team is first class. ([Location 51](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=51))
- Your cafe can be a fun, energetic, and lively place to be that is constantly changing and interacting with everyone around it in some way. ([Location 56](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=56))
- great way to summarise the above questions is with a mission statement. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=77))
- Just having a mission statement that everyone in your business is aware of and making that your measure of success will separate your cafe from 95% of all other cafes in your city. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=79))
- convenience stores - ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=90))
- You need to be very clear about what you do - are you a specialty sandwich bar? If so, you need to sell the best sandwiches in the area and all the other products you sell will be designed to complement your sandwich menu. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=91))
- We don't claim to have the best chocolate brownies in town, or the most delicious fresh juices, but when it comes to coffee we want to be the best. ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=97))
- Instead, focus on what you are good at and try to be the best in a particular area. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=99))
- To decide on this, the easiest way is to think about a few questions: Which products are you most interested in learning about and becoming an expert in? Do you have a natural advantage with your existing knowledge base? Does the layout of your cafe lend itself to a particular type of product? ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=100))
    - Note: panini
- But remember, if you choose to specialise in a particular product, you don't need to be the best in the world (although this would certainly help...), you just need to be the best in your local area. ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=106))
- Product Pricing ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=107))
- about your pricing. The key here is to first know your market before you price your products. Who are your customers? ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=108))
- Discounting products immediately takes away the perception of quality. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=119))
- We have maintained our position as having the most expensive coffee in the area, and we have been able to do this because we are constantly improving our knowledge of coffee, and therefore our product. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=121))
- Location ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=122))
- However, you may be looking to create a destination store. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=124))
- many cafe consumers now love the idea of finding the latest hidden gem or relying on word-of-mouth marketing. Nothing ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=125))
    - Note: Le Café du coin, un incontournable à l'est de Mtl
- second machine, and immediately doubled our coffee making capacity ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=136))
- The lesson in this is to look carefully at your retail space. Are you generating as much turnover as possible out of every square metre you have? If not, what can you change? Remember, you are paying rent for every centimetre of your cafe. ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=140))
- This can be as simple as offering the morning newspaper, ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=145))
- You need to carefully consider your location (customers, urgency level, environment) before you design your operational model. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=148))
- Make sure you're selling a product and experience that the locals will want. There is no point in pitching a product and experience to a market who can't relate. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=149))
- Leases ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=150))
- Your systems will be tight, your branding will be strong, your numbers will be great, and you will have a good lease arrangement. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=152))
- Quote of Note: ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=176))
- Quick Tips ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=179))
- Creating an environment where people have autonomy in their jobs and can have an element of self-direction will have a huge effect on productivity. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=192))
- Your staff will feel more involved in the overall success of the business if they feel like they are trusted, respected, and important. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=195))
- Owning any business is about testing and measuring what works. Everything is a learning curve. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=198))
- It's great to have different personalities or people who may complement each other well. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=210))
- Firstly, we would offer the employee the opportunity to justify the error or incident that may have occurred. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=220))
- Secondly, we would ask the staff member how they thought they could have better dealt with the situation. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=222))
- The compliment sandwich is a delicious way of saying to someone, "We like what you're doing in one area, but you need to work on X, Y, and Z, and you're doing great in another area." This way the staff member will leave the meeting with a positive feeling about certain aspects of their work but know that, as open, honest employers, we expect more. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=224))
- If a third breach occurred, the staff member would be let go. This ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=228))
- The idea is to take enough time in the hiring process to minimise risk of future issues. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=231))
- Having baristas with big egos can create conflict or embarrassment and it can all come at a high price. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=239))
- In order of priority: Willing to learn Takes initiative Team player Customer focused Self-aware and coordinated Moves quickly Has a great SMILE ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=241))
    - Note: criteres d emploi
- On the flip side, when employing a manager, be prepared to pay if you hire someone specifically for this position. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=248))
- Sure, you might need to be full-time to start with, but you have bigger things to worry about like systemising your business, managing cash flow, coming up with new marketing initiatives, testing and measuring, and hiring staff (all of these tasks can be passed on to your manager once the business is systemised). Invest time and money in your manager. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=256))
- Key traits to look for in a manager are: Strong decision-making ability Industry experience (or experience in your business) Expertise in your specialty (i.e. coffee, sandwiches) A great understanding of customer service Team player Can deal with conflict in a diplomatic and calm manner Positive role model for younger staff Excellent communicator Has a great SMILE! ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=259))
    - Note: crfitres e.moi manager
- Crowd Pleasers Pleasing the crowd is another way of taking care of your customers. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=266))
- Look to hire people who have some kind of x-factor. Can they make conversation with anyone, anytime? Do they have a contagious smile which makes your customers feel good? Are they particularly good-looking? Does their tireless work ethic rub off on the other members of the team? Whatever it is, if you can find team members with the x-factor, it can make all the difference. As you build your team and they ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=267))
- you create community through your staff, people will become attached to your business and not only will they become regulars, they will then become your best form of marketing and promotion: word of mouth. ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=273))
- Initially it cost us a bit more in terms of salary than most people might have been prepared to pay, but having a strong leader whom the team respected was critical to our success. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=283))
- His secret was simple: smile and enjoy work. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=286))
- How did we ensure he enjoyed work? By giving him control, ensuring he felt he had ownership of his role and, most importantly, that we looked after him when it came to salary and what he needed in terms of time off, flexibility, and a positive work environment. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=286))
- Advisors ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=308))
- This can range from formal business advisors (for example accountants and lawyers) to more informal mentors who have either done what you are aiming to do or have a great understanding of something that you do not. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=310))
- bookkeeper with experience ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=317))
- Another one of the key people you need on your team is a good solicitor. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=322))
- Again, find a lawyer who can remove the complexity of legal jargon for you. The more time you spend talking to your lawyer, the better you will get at understanding the way they interpret your legal documents. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=324))

- As entrepreneurs, it's important to come up with your own brand, identity, and systems. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=352))
- Before you sign a lease or open the doors to your new hospitality venture, you should be looking at the best operators in your industry. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=354))
- What are they doing differently? Why are they so busy? Why do people want to be here? Take some time to try their products, talk to their staff, and soak up the experience of visiting their business to get some clues as to why they are successful. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=355))
- Hospitality is about looking after people, entertaining, taking care of customers, and providing a quality product with great service - also known as being hospitable. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=358))
    - Note: critere
- relies on a range of factors that can transform your cafe from a good, reliable, enjoyable experience to a place where people want to spend time and be seen. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=361))
- Be Progressive ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=363))
    - Note: av garde
- Remember that your staff members often have skills beyond what their job description says, and they will love that you have noticed! ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=366))
- Be an early adopter and make your business name and brand stand out. When we named our first cafe, we ran a competition with our customers to come up with ideas. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=368))
    - Note: 1
- being on the forefront of product development. In our ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=373))
- from someone who sources and roasts their own beans and has a great understanding of the intricacies of the coffee making process, who are they going to choose? ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=374))
    - Note: 2
- Being an expert (at some level) is definitely a big part of the cool factor. Remember, ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=385))
- this can cross over to any product - whatever you specialize in, be an expert. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=385))
- This doesn't have to be expensive, it just has to be different and more interesting than what your competitors are doing. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=387))
- If you don't have the finances to create some kind of artistic or unique statement, make sure your business appears slick, clean, and organised. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=388))
- Having seen some of the best pop-up bars and cafes, we decided we would build seating and tables out of recycled materials. We used an old garden fence as wallpaper, brightly coloured shipping pallets as tables (with a bit of Perspex on top as a surface), and "found" some spare milk crates, which we turned into seats. This created a unique look in a very plastic central city environment where people would not only stop to have coffee and lunch, but they would stop and take photos! Grabbing people's attention and giving them something unique is important. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=390))
- Key questions to ask yourself: ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=394))
- How can you create an innovative loyalty scheme? Can you offer a pre-pay card? ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=395))
- Get the customer to pay for 10 coffees and have 12 on the card. You buy loyalty with offerings of this nature. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=397))
- What feature can you bring into your cafe to create a point of difference? ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=398))
- Think about seats, tables, decor, cutlery, crockery, colours, music, staff uniforms (or no uniforms), etc. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=398))
- Question the way you do simple tasks on the customer side and ask yourself if there is a more interesting way. Can you replace table numbers with something more interesting? Can you serve water in something other than a glass? What unique element can the staff contribute? ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=399))
- Encouraging your staff to contribute to the business's marketing will also give them a feeling of belonging. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=404))
- What competitions can you run in-store or through social media to create a sense of community? ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=405))
- Buy an iPad and give it away to one lucky customer just for doing a customer survey! It ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=406))
- Also, the information you will yield is priceless - always ensure any survey you do has an email address requirement for the entry to be valid. This way you build a database (adding value to your business when you go to sell it) and you can direct market through an e-newsletter. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=407))
- Know the Market ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=410))
- Know your competition and what the best in the business are doing. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=410))
- means getting out and exploring the best operators in your industry, collecting ideas and modifying them to suit the needs of your business. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=412))
- By having slightly higher prices we are able to differentiate and create a stronger perceived value. The customer might pay a bit more for their coffee, but they know they are getting a better product. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=414))
- Being 10-20% more expensive than the rest not only adds to your bottom line, but it affords you the opportunity to be a bit more generous with your staff. If your staff are aware that the business is successful enough to offer them progression within their role or better financial rewards, they will remain loyal. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=415))
- Researching and understanding your product is critical. Every ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=417))
- As we learned about the coffee industry, we stumbled across many methods from espresso (the mainstay of our operation) through to cold drip, syphon, pour-over, and French press. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=419))
- cold drip coffee maker. Obviously ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=422))
- but having a cold drip set up on our counter created a talking point for many of our coffee-drinking customers who were curious as to what it was, how it worked, and what it tasted like. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=423))
- Having staff who were able to talk about different brewing methods, offer tasting notes, and engage in conversation about our key product gave us even more credibility as a coffee specialist. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=428))
- This is not deceptive, but merely involving the customer and encouraging feedback. Ensuring they believe you are an expert is more important in the end, but you can have some fun bringing your customers into the process of product research or development. A lot of our menu has been designed by customers in some way. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=434))
- Quick Tips Innovate and look for ways to reward your customers and enhance the community around your business. Get your customers on board to help design your menu or product mix. Understand your market and don't be afraid to be premium! Tap into the skills you have on your staff; let them take some creative control and contribute to the atmosphere and ambience of your store. Stay humble and look for ideas from industry leaders. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=438))

- Values are another key component, so make some time to decide on the values of the business with your team. Your values help determine the way you operate and the decisions you make. What type of environment do they want to work in? How can the business help them develop as a person and learn new skills?… ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=458))

- The other key component to our philosophy was good old-fashioned honesty and fun. We wanted our customer experience to ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=485))
- Fussy customers may seem difficult, but if you nail their order on their first visit and remember their name on their second visit, you've got a new, loyal customer who will not only keep coming back, but likely tell their friends about their amazing experience and provide you with first class testimonials. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=487))
- The fun factor is important for both your team and your customers. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=490))
- Ensure that your staff feels like they can ask questions and come up with ideas. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=492))
- but a team effort where employees are respected and they can bring their strengths to the table. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EEJQK9I&location=494))
- Honesty is critical in dealing with both our staff and our customers. If you're going to bump your prices up, don't be sneaky about it. Why not write your customers a letter, post it online, on the counter, or on a poster, and explain that you know that 50c extra per coffee is not ideal or $1.00 extra per sandwich is not what anyone wants, but in order to continue to up-skill your staff and improve your products, you have to make allowances for cost.

- It can be seen as a fine line of Facebook terms of use, but we used to offer all our fans the chance to win a $100 prepay coffee card every month, just for "liking" us on Facebook! It was a simple way of getting people's attention, and by running advertising campaigns offering free coffee, we found our fan base could grow by hundreds in a matter of days. The campaigns are very simple and all instructions to develop these are on Facebook. It's a simple step-by-step process where you decide your budget, usually on a cost per click (CPC) basis, and take it from there. The trick is to run multiple campaigns using different keywords and images to see which adverts work best with new customers.

- We are not encouraging you to create a destination that looks like McDonalds, but to create consistency in your business and encourage your staff to up-sell along the lines of the classic, "Do you want fries with that?" This is absolutely crucial to not only maintaining your regulars, but adding to your average dollar sale by ensuring that add-ons are a part of your service script.

- You should aim to develop lists for as many tasks as possible in your cafe. Whether it is how to clean the floors, how to wash the dishes, or how to make a coffee, it has to be done consistently. To do this you need to establish either the best way to do something, or your way of doing something. For example, if the task is cleaning the floors, you may know the perfect amount of disinfectant to use in the bucket of water (which still cleans the floors, but keeps your costs down by limiting the amount used) and where the team member should start and finish so they don't have to walk back over the wet floor and leave footprints. This sounds pedantic, but if it is done correctly every time, the cleanliness of the floor will never be an issue again.
