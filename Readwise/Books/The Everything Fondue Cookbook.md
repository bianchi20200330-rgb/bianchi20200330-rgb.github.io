## Highlights
- A broader definition separates fondues into four basic categories: cheese, broth-based, oil-based, and dessert. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=114))

- Today, many Asian countries have their own version of a hot pot dish, such as Korean bulgogi and Japanese shabu-shabu. Sukiyaki, Japan's most popular one-pot meal, technically doesn't qualify as a hot pot dish, since the food isn't cooked in broth. However, it can still be considered a type of fondue.

- Finally, plan on having one fondue pot accommodate four people. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=150))

- A special type of hot pot, designed for fiery Szechwan cuisine, splits the broth into two compartments. This allows cooks to prepare two types of broth. Noted for its spiciness, the first broth is seasoned with garlic, chilies, and Szechwan peppercorns. The second is a traditional hot pot broth, which is similar to a consommé.

- Like chocolate, cheese scorches easily. In addition, overcooked cheese can develop a rubbery texture. Always use a heavy-bottomed metal saucepan when melting cheese, and cook slowly over low heat. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=227))

- Finally, a candy or deep-fry thermometer is ideal for ensuring that the oil has reached the high temperatures needed for cooking. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=229))

- The most important utensil is the fondue dipping fork. Longer than regular table forks, dipping forks are designed to spear food and hold it while immersing it in the fondue. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=233))

- Made of mesh with a long handle, fondue dipping baskets are essentially small strainers. Used primarily in broth fondues, they add variety by allowing you to cook soft foods such as lettuce, spinach, and dumplings that are difficult to spear with a fork. In oil fondues, they are often used when it's more convenient to cook a side dish all at once. For example, in Breaded Red Snapper (page 135), the chopped onion is cooked in the dipping basket, leaving guests free to dip the pieces of breaded fish.

- Another handy accessory for broth- and oil-based fondues is a party tray with a large number of compartments for holding dipping sauces. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=240))

- For hygienic reasons, people frequently prefer to have individual bowls of dipping sauces for oil- and broth-based fondues. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=242))

- When providing ramekins, be sure to adjust the quantity of dipping sauce called for in the recipe, to ensure that everyone has at least ¼ cup of every type of dip. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=246))

- When choosing ingredients for oil- and broth-based fondues, there are three basic rules to follow: aged beef, fresh fish, and firm vegetables. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=254))

- The best type of cheese for fondue is a hard cheese that has been aged for several months. Hard cheeses have a sharp flavor, are easy to dice or shred, and melt easily due to their high fat content. The two standard Swiss fondue cheeses, Gruyère and Emmenthal, both fall into this category. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=261))

- A good fondue cheese has a high-fat content and a medium-to-low moisture content. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=266))

- Examples of semisoft cheeses include Dutch Gouda, Danish Havarti, and Italian provolone and Fontina. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=268))

- While valued for their sharp flavor, fresh cheeses such as Brie, feta, and Gorgonzola usually play a secondary role in a fondue. A small amount of the crumbled cheese is paired with a larger amount of hard or semisoft cheese. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=269))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- soft cheeses such as cottage or ricotta are normally used only in dessert fondues. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=270))

    - Note: ???
- Traditionally, white wine is used to melt the fondue cheese. When it's time to add the cornstarch thickener, a small amount of alcohol helps dissolve the cornstarch while providing extra flavor. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=272))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- For best results, use a dry white wine or flat beer with cheese fondue. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=274))

- Kirsch is traditionally added in the final stages of preparing cheese fondue. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=276))

- Cheese fondues can also be made by melting cheese with milk. This is a good choice when you're serving fondue for the whole family or melting softer cheeses such as ricotta. Expect to use less liquid when replacing wine with milk in a fondue recipe. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=280))

- Couverture, the best type of chocolate, must contain at least 32 percent cocoa butter. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=283))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- However, most people prefer the taste of semisweet chocolate. Milk chocolate can also be used and has the advantage of being less expensive. Avoid using unsweetened chocolate unless the recipe calls for it, or be prepared to add a large quantity of sugar to compensate. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=296))

- Cream is the second most important ingredient in a dessert fondue. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=299))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Heavy whipping cream — also known as heavy cream or double cream — has a fat content of over 36 percent. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=308))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- The texture and cooking properties of heavy cream mean that it is frequently partnered with chocolate in fondue recipes. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001OLRLKG&location=309))
