- The number of new projects is huge, competition is tight, and you’ll barely find an idea which raises more than $100,000 without spending money on advertising. ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=100))

- due to the failed projects, delays with product delivery and other negative experiences backer confidence has been lost and new creators must try harder than before. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=170))
- Communicating honestly helps create stronger relationships, so the backers are more lenient when the creator is late because the basis of supporting a project is not just to purchase a product, but also to help fulfill the creator‘s dream.

- That’s why you'll have to understand what your potential backers look like, where to find them, and how to gauge their interest before starting the campaign. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=193))

- Unlike those who peacefully create something in their garage, the people who receive a large amount of funding through crowdfunding will experience constant pressure from the backers waiting for the promised product and the media that watches their every move through a magnifying glass.

- Indiegogo also gives you access to backers’ email addresses while you’re live. This gives you the possibility to create lookalike audiences of these backers and target them via Facebook ads. Kickstarter offers the possibility to insert a Google Analytics tracking ID and there’s a feature called Custom Referral Tags which allows you to create custom links and track if someone backed the project using this link.

([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=700))

- A/B testing, performed by creating newsletters, ads, websites, applications, etc. It helps ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=706))

- you can use Facebook ads. ([Location 1638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1638))
- Let’s start with the main terms in online advertising that you should know. Reach—the number of people who have seen your ads within a certain period. This indicator shows the number of people who have seen it, regardless of the number of times the advertisement has been shown to them. Impressions—the number of times your ads were on screen for your target audience. Different from reach, impressions also include cases where the ad is shown to the same person several times. Cost per thousand impressions (CPM)—the cost of showing the ad a thousand times. Cost per click (CPC)—the cost of one click. Pay per click (PPC) is one of the online advertising types where you pay for a click on the ad. Click-through rate (CTR)—the conversion rate in percentage. It shows what percentage of the people who saw that advertisement then clicked on it. This indicator shows the quality of the ad. If the click-through rate is low, it indicates that your ad set (text or the graphic element) isn’t engaging, or that you are showing it to the wrong audience. Cost per lead (CPL)—the average cost of a potential client’s contact (email). Facebook has a special type of advertising—Lead Ads, dedicated to the acquisition of potential clients’ contacts. When this type is chosen, Facebook users fill out a special form on the platform itself, without being redirected to the external website. It is convenient for users because they don’t need to leave Facebook to fill in their contact details after clicking an ad. Customer acquisition cost (CAC)—the cost of attracting a new client through advertising. If you know the self-cost of your product and your profit margin, it will be easy for you to calculate how much you can spend on advertising for it to pay off. ([Location 1641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1641))
- we are talking about preparing for a crowdfunding campaign, we will concentrate on one specific goal—to collect potential backer emails. For this you will need to: Create an account for your project on Facebook; Gather a target audience (you can first set a wide audience by using a geographic location, age, gender, and interests. Later, by observing the advertising results, slowly narrow down the criteria and select several segments, so you can see which brings the best results); Choose a few pictures and write a few text lines that you will use for different ad sets, which will be shown to a selected audience (it is especially important that the ad is oriented to the needs of a specific client because the more people from the target audience engage with the ad and find it relevant, the less you have to pay for it); Build a landing page for the collection of contacts (this is recommended, but not obligatory, if you decide to use the Lead Ads function on Facebook); Write a series of automated emails to warm up potential backers you have collected. ([Location 1671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1671))
- the ability to do precise segmentation. ([Location 1696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1696))
- You can define things like gender, age, geographic location (you can find information about the countries and cities where most backers come from by analyzing the “Community” section of Kickstarter campaigns that are similar to yours), interests, behaviors, etc., while setting who should see your ads. By using the Facebook advertising tool Audience Insights and entering the desired criteria, you will find out how many people that match your audience can be reached using Facebook ads. ([Location 1696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1696))
- You should run A/B tests of the same ad set (image and text) by changing just one element (gender, country, interest, etc.) in your filter. In this way, you will learn which audience engages with your ads better. ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1701))
- Lead Ads. ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1706))
- That’s why Lead Ads is a great option for those who want to collect leads without a landing page. ([Location 1708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1708))
- Try to sell your product and see if people spend their money on it. I’m sure you’ll agree that buying your product before it’s even created is the best metric to see if your product has a demand. ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1732))
- First, you’ll need to have a website ready and optimize it to achieve a good conversion rate for simple email signups. Run a few A/B tests with different versions of your landing page and see which one converts better. ([Location 1735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1735))
- Once you have at least a few hundred leads, you can send them an email by saying that they can be the first to pre-order your product. ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1738))

- Find the Email Address of Any Professional ([Location 1991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1991))
- If this information is not present, find the journalist’s personal blog (if they have one) or profile on Twitter (which is often used by journalists) and see if they have contacts listed there. You can immediately start following the journalist ([Location 1995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=1995))
- Writing an Email Pitch to Journalists ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2007))
- The subject has to be concise, clear, and accurate. ([Location 2009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2009))
- Creating a Press Kit If journalists are interested in your idea and it seems appropriate to them to publish an article, you will need a press kit, also known as a media kit. This is a package of resources and information provided to journalists to brief them about your product. I suggest storing press kit files on your website (yourwebsite.com/presskit) or in a shared DropBox, Google Drive, or OneDrive folder. ([Location 2135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2135))
- The press release is made up of several parts: headline, introduction, more details about the news, descriptions of company activities and contact information. ([Location 2144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2144))
- Influencers can be journalists, bloggers, sport or entertainment stars, associations, organizations, the leaders in their area, experts, social media giants who have lots of followers, or any other people who have a smaller or larger audience and create value for their followers or charm them in some way. Influencers have an audience and can drive traffic to your project. ([Location 2217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2217))

- Then you can establish first contact—just say hello, and give them a compliment or a reason why their profile interests you. For example, on Twitter, you could write: “Hi @Name, I’m a big fan of your work, looking forward to reading more of your tweets!” Just as in real life, you should not start presenting your project immediately, and the same goes in social media; you should start with a non-binding greeting and show of respect.

- Viral Videos ([Location 2358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2358))
- viral video is a video that becomes popular through a viral process of sharing through social media, YouTube, email, or other channels. Such videos spread quickly and attract a large audience. ([Location 2359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2359))
- First, make a list of companies that share viral videos. Some of them are: LADbible, UNILAD, Viral Thread, 5-Minute Crafts, Mashable, The Dodo, Food Network, Jake Boys, BuzzFeed Tasty. Most publishers specialize in specific fields, e.g. the BuzzFeed Tasty network specializes in food. Choose companies that are related to your niche. You can find them in search engines by entering keywords like “Top Facebook Video Publishers,” “Top 10 Video Creators,” etc. or on social networks. Next, get familiarized with the rules of video publishers. ([Location 2379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2379))

- Create an Account for Facebook Ads ([Location 2455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2455))
- Make a List of Journalists and Influencers ([Location 2468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2468))
- Support a Few Projects ([Location 2472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2472))
- you are new to Kickstarter, first you’ll need to create your profile in the platform: add your photo, name, a bio, and links to your website and social media profiles. Then, the first step to start a new project is to choose the category. As mentioned earlier, there are 15 project categories on Kickstarter: Art, Comics, Crafts, Dance, Design, Fashion, Film & Video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publishing, Technology, and Theater. ([Location 2491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2491))
- Projects must create something to share with others. Projects must be honest and clearly presented. Projects can’t fundraise for charity. Projects can't offer equity. Projects can't involve prohibited items (drugs, alcohol, nicotine, weapons, political fundraising, etc. Full list can be found here). ([Location 2577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2577))
- The fourth rule is also similar to the third. If you want to offer equity, choose an equity-based crowdfunding platform, such as Seedrs or Crowdcube ([Location 2610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2610))
- Confirm Your Identity and Link a Bank Account ([Location 2614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2614))
- Step 2: Project Image, Title, and Funding Goal Next you’ll have to upload your project’s title and ([Location 2628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2628))
- Project Image This is the first thing that visitors see when they open your project page on Kickstarter. ([Location 2633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2633))
- Project Title The title of your project should be simple, specific, and memorable. As discussed previously, it should also represent your USP. ([Location 2639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2639))
- Short Blurb Here you can add a short description of your project and reveal a bit more detail than in the title. The short blurb has a limit of 135 characters. If you manage to reach a higher ranking in your category or on other Kickstarter search pages (“Recommended for You,” “Trending,” “Projects We Love,” etc.), the short blurb will appear with your project image. ([Location 2647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2647))
- Category and Subcategory Here you can edit the category that you chose earlier. You may also choose a subcategory, which is optional, but it allows you to put your product in a certain niche. ([Location 2653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2653))
- Project Location Here you can specify location of your project. It can be any city/country, ([Location 2659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2659))
- Funding Goal and Duration We’ve already discussed how to set a funding goal in the section “Setting a Goal.” The funding duration on Kickstarter can last from 1 to 60 days. ([Location 2662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2662))
- Project Collaborators If you are running your project with a team or with the help of an agency, you may add project collaborators and grant them permissions for your project ([Location 2669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2669))
- Step 3: Project Video The video is one of the most important parts of the campaign. Most users prefer to quickly watch a video, rather than reading the project description. ([Location 2674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2674))
- Videos are not required to launch the project, but Kickstarter statistics show that campaigns with compelling videos have a double success rate, compared to projects without videos. So why not double the chances of your success? ([Location 2676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2676))
- The video should answer these listed questions in a concise manner: ●        What are you planning to make? ●        What problem does your product solve? ●        How is it unique or different from other alternatives? ●        What is your product meant for? ●        How can someone use your product? ([Location 2683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2683))
- keep your viewers’ attention, the video should last up to 2 minutes. The first 30 seconds are the most important, since they determine if someone will finish watching the video or turn it off. ([Location 2692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2692))
- For everything to go smoothly, you will have to write a script for the video—what will be said and shown. Rarely will you be able to do it successfully from the first ([Location 2707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2707))
- Step 4: Project Description When creating a description, think from the perspective of your target audience. If you were considering buying your own product, what would you want to know before making up your mind? The ([Location 2711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2711))
- the “Risks and challenges” field, mention the risks which your backers may encounter. Inform them about possible inconveniences (which are usually related to late production and late delivery to backers) and what you will do in these cases. ([Location 2728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2728))
- Step 5: Rewards and Shipping Costs ([Location 2736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2736))
- Why do people back projects on crowdfunding platforms? Firstly, they want to be a part of the community that supports creators and encourages them to realize their ideas. ([Location 2737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2737))
- Reward Description When setting rewards, you will have to: ●        write the title of the reward; ●        add a short description (you may also add a list of items included in this reward); ●        set the price; ([Location 2746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2746))
- set the estimated delivery date; ●        add shipping details (no shipping involved (for digital products), shipping to certain countries only, or worldwide shipping); ●        set the delivery price (you may apply a different price for each country or region); ●        set number of units, if the reward is limited (in the case of early bird rewards) or add a start and end date if you want a reward to be available during a certain time period. ([Location 2754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2754))
- Donation Without a Reward ([Location 2783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2783))
- We already discussed that it is vital to get active backers on the first day. All creators are working hard on their pre-launch strategy, building email lists, outreaching media and influencers, and posting in social media. But there’s one group of people who will most probably be your first supporters—your friends and family. ([Location 2789](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2789))
- The Kickstarter platform creates these lowest-tier rewards automatically. ([Location 2794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2794))
- Early Bird Rewards Another type of reward, which is really important for all projects, is an early bird reward. It is a limited amount of your product, offered for a discounted price to the most loyal backers who joined your email list or expressed their interest in your project in another way during your pre-launch campaign. The number of early bird rewards is limited (50, 100, 200 units, or similar) and you can create several levels of them: for example, 50 units for $20—super early bird, 50 units for $25—early bird, etc. ([Location 2799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2799))
- Setting the Reward Price ([Location 2808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2808))
- For example, if you plan to sell the same product in the future for $100, when presenting the project, sell it for $80–90. When allowing the option to purchase several units of the product, make an appropriate discount, so the backers will be sufficiently motivated to choose this reward. ([Location 2814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2814))
- The Largest Rewards The final reward level, which resides at the bottom of the list, is the largest reward. These are usually related to a unique personal experience or something special that the creator can offer. ([Location 2820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2820))
- When setting a necessary financial goal, evaluate how many units of the project you will have to sell to reach your goal. Don’t include the largest rewards in your prediction. It is always better to expect less and be surprised when the campaign takes an unexpected turn. If it so happens that some generous backer chooses that largest available reward, that moment will be one of the most amazing in your life, I have no doubt about it! ([Location 2839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2839))
- Step 6: Project Preview While creating a project, you may edit and proofread it dozens of times. Don’t be surprised if there are mistakes that you just don’t notice, simply because you have looked at the same text too many times. That’s why it’s good to ask your friends to have a fresh look by providing them a project preview link. ([Location 2843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2843))
- Wrap-up and Action Plan Complete the Account Verification Process ([Location 2855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2855))
- Create a Video ([Location 2861](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2861))
- You can get ideas for the video from other projects. Make a script for your video clip by using adjusted text from your landing page and email sequence. Create a scenario, then select a shooting place and date. At the end of the video, encourage the viewer to back your project. ([Location 2862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2862))
- Describe Your Project ([Location 2864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2864))
- Create Rewards ([Location 2868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2868))
- Submit the Project for Review ([Location 2872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2872))
- Get Reviews from Your Friends and Make Adjustments ([Location 2875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2875))
- Get Your Crowd Ready and Send the Press Release ([Location 2879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2879))
- Running the campaign isn’t so hard if you’ve done your pre-launch strategy properly. By now, you should have a list of potential backers, influencers who have tried your product and are ready to share your project with their followers, a list of relevant journalists who have previously written about similar topics, and your family and friends who have agreed to back your  project with at least a symbolic donation. If you have that ready, it’s time to make a next step—press the “Launch” button. ([Location 2886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2886))
- It’s important to note that backers can cancel their pledge anytime before your campaign concludes. That’s why I recommend sending a private message through Kickstarter to everyone who has just become your backer. This way, you’ll be able to contact them privately again if they decide to cancel their pledge. If you haven’t done this, you will lose the opportunity to contact them, find the reason for their cancelation, and provide the right argument to retain their pledge. ([Location 2905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2905))
- Holidays Timing is also important if you want your backers to get their rewards by a certain event or holiday. Christmas is probably the most popular date. In such ([Location 2918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2918))
- Also, try to avoid launching in late November, any of December, and the beginning of the New Year. ([Location 2925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2925))
- Day of the Week If possible, launch your campaign in the middle of a month, when employees get paid, as they feel a bit wealthier on their payday. You can start the project between Tuesday and Thursday (unless it is a big public holiday) —during those days, people are more willing to accept information. ([Location 2929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2929))
- Kickstarter sends an automated reminder 48 hours before the project ends. That’s why you may get an influx of backers in the final 48 hours, if many people clicked the “Remind Me” button. Because of this, I’d recommend you end your project on Thursday, so that people get this reminder on Tuesday. ([Location 2937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2937))
- You should start your project in the morning in your target audience's time zone. ([Location 2943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2943))
- The Launch Day ([Location 2948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2948))
- Your ultimate goal is to reach 100% funding within 24 hours. ([Location 2950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2950))
- Your minimal target should be around 30% of your funding goal within 48 hours, so if you achieve this or a higher result, you can consider it a good start. ([Location 2954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2954))
- Here’s the main list of things you need to do during the first minutes after launching your campaign: ●        Send a newsletter to potential backers who opted in to the mailing list. ●        Send private messages to your friends, family, and colleagues through the same communication channel that you use with them regularly. ●        Email journalists, bloggers, and influencers. Previously, I recommended informing them a week before launch, so this will be your second follow up, confirming that the project is already live. ●        Make a post in social media (your personal profile and the project profile) and your blog (if you have one). ●        Post to relevant forums, social media groups, and other websites where you’ve previously engaged with the community during the pre-launch. Don’t spam. ●        Redirect traffic from your landing page to your Kickstarter page. Before launching, your site has been used to collect leads, and now it should point all site visitors to your campaign. ●        Add your pre-written FAQ onto the project page. Kickstarter allows you to add an FAQ only once the project is live, so prepare it in advance and when the time comes, just copy and paste it. ([Location 2956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2956))
- All main tasks should be prepared in advance. You should create the necessary texts, emails, and posts in social media and schedule them. ([Location 2974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2974))
- Prepare to Refuse Offers After having started your campaign, hundreds or even thousands of various individual consultants or agencies which offer services to crowdfunding project authors will find out about it. They try to sell their services as soon as you hit the “Launch” button. ([Location 2985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=2985))
- Communication with Backers After having launched the project, you will receive emails, messages, and comments from potential and current backers. Review them constantly and reply as quickly as possible. You can also communicate with your Kickstarter audience by posting project updates. It is like a mini blog for the most important events and information related to your project. ([Location 3005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=3005))
- You can post a few updates during your campaign and you can select if they will be seen publicly or if only your backers will see them. Here are few ideas for when you can post a comment: ●        You reached a significant number of backers (100, 200, 500, etc.). ●        Kickstarter mentioned your project in their newsletter or social feed, or selected it as the “Project We Love.” ●        You raised 50, 100 or 200% of your goal. ●        The press covered your project (you can also highlight this in the project description page by mentioning media outlets that wrote about you). ●        A well-known influencer shared something interesting about your project. ●        You received a great piece of feedback from your backer.

- Another way to upsell something is to create new rewards and encourage backers to choose them instead of their old reward. In this case, take your project link and then add /pledge/new/ to the end of the link. New rewards are usually introduced with stretch goals. ([Location 3057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=3057))
- Stretch Goals In the previous chapters, I have already mentioned that it is recommended to set a low funding goal, but one that is still sufficient to bring your project to life. If you quickly reach 100% funding, the snowball effect will come into play and that will encourage more people to support your campaign. After having reached the primary goal, you can create a stretch goal. ([Location 3060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=3060))

You have to actively communicate with your backers via project updates, private messages, emails, and social networks, and encourage them to contribute to the new goal by explaining what additional value they will get in exchange. After having created stretch ([Location 3070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=3070))
- Even though a stretch goal is a good strategy in general, as it allows you to raise more money, improve your product, and give your backers additional features they want, it is not suitable for every project.

- When it comes to getting new backers, we see time and time again that getting the word out through your own existing networks is the most effective. Many people browsing Kickstarter do look around for new projects to back, but the majority of the people who find and back your project will be friends, friends of friends, or fans of the work you do.

- There’s no secret recipe for how to get featured in the "Projects We Love,” but here are few general tips that you can follow in order to have the best possible chance of catching the eye of the Kickstarter staff: Start with a strong idea—and express it clearly. Choose a title which is short and clear. Don’t overhype it. Proofread it to make sure your text is free of typos. Choose a compelling project image. Make it clear, bright, and simple. Don’t cover your images with badges (“Staff pick,” “Free Shipping,” “Live on Kickstarter,” etc.), or other distracting graphics. Put the most important information first. Make sure your project description page starts with a short and clear statement about what you’re doing. Imagine that someone is skimming just the first two paragraphs. What information would you want them to see? Illustrate your description and rewards. Do not limit yourself to text; use high-quality photos, videos, and GIFs in your description. Eye-catching images and GIFs make your story more engaging. Show something related to your creative process: sketches of the first prototype, moments from your life in your studio, etc. When you describe rewards, you can only add text, so show images of your rewards in the project description. Stay oriented to your target audience and don’t spam. Send emails to those who have expressed their interest in receiving notifications from you. Don’t promote your project where it shouldn’t be promoted or send unsolicited messages to people you don’t know. Whether you’re doing it via email or on social networks, it’s against Kickstarter’s Community Guidelines and could get you suspended from the platform. Check other “Projects We Love” and subscribe to the Kickstarter newsletter. This will help you to get an idea of which projects they feature. Most of them will have well-crafted videos, striking images, a clear plan, an excited community, and a lot of creativity. Maybe you’ll find some inspiration that you can use for your project. As you see, those tips aren’t something extraordinary. ([Location 3118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=3118))
- Finally, you can write a short story about your project and send an email to stories@kickstarter.com. I suggest sending it not immediately after launching your project, but after a more significant event, such as when your project is noticed by a famous media outlet, your video becomes viral, or you are interviewed about your project on some TV show. If you haven’t reached any significant event, just write a short but heartfelt email, emphasizing why your project is important and exceptional. Since those emails are reviewed by Kickstarter staff, honesty and real emotions can influence their decisions.

([Location 3316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=3316))
- The last project I collaborated in received £13,927 gross pledges and of these, £2,420 were dropped… That was more than 17% of the total funding! I was expecting that we could lose up to 10% due to different problems related to credit card processing, but 17% of dropped pledges really shocked me. Anyway, you can’t predict everything. From the remaining amount of £11,507, Kickstarter deducted a 5% platform fee (£575.35) and around 3% (£355.75) for the payment processing, which left us with £10,575.90.

- Indiegogo InDemand Once your Kickstarter campaign ends, you cannot accept new backers there, but you can still continue pre-orders elsewhere until your product is ready for mass production. I suggest selling through your website, although it may take time to get it ready. Another option is to take advantage of Indiegogo’s InDemand program, which allows you to continue taking orders from your backers without deadlines or an additional fundraising goal. It’s like a bridge between crowdfunding and commerce. ([Location 3348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Y23CMPY&location=3348))
- Transition from Kickstarter to Indiegogo InDemand is quite easy. You may contact the Indiegogo team by email indemand@indiegogo.com for more questions.

- The creator can realize their idea in a certain time by using the money collected for pre-orders, and the supporter feels moral satisfaction because they have helped to realize the author’s idea. This increases the responsibility of young creators. When they are realizing their ideas for the first time, they are learning the basics of business processes and the supporters can look at the author of the idea not as another salesman but as a person who is willing to sacrifice their time and resources to realize their dream.
