- Wordpress comes with various widget options upon its installation. Some of the widget choices include a search bar, recent posts box, and calendar. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C77U612&location=795))
- For example, if you installed an e-commerce theme, that theme may include certain functionalities that you can move around in your widget areas such as a popular product box, customer review box, etc. ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C77U612&location=798))
- To access your widget areas, click on the Widget Tab listed underneath the Appearance Tab on the left side navigation of your Wordpress Dashboard. In ([Location 805](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C77U612&location=805))
- Webmasters have two choices when adding content to their websites: Pages and Posts (Blog Posts). ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C77U612&location=821))
- Pages are where you will place your static content. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C77U612&location=823))
- Other pages include contact pages, FAQ pages, testimonial pages, or informational pages that will always hold true. A page about your company’s history is another great example, as this information never becomes outdated or inaccurate.

- Posts ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C77U612&location=838))
- The use of Posts are intended for those looking to make a quick announcement, discuss a timely topic or event, and/or to easily address the readers of the website. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C77U612&location=842))
- Wordpress has created Categories and Tags for website owners to better catalogue their Posts. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C77U612&location=848))
- Categories allow one to broadly group their Posts according to the content of the Post. For instance, you may produce several Posts that all have to do with marketing. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C77U612&location=849))
- Additionally, Wordpress allows users to “Tag” their Posts as well. This is just another tool to help catalogue content on a more granular level. For instance, your marketing related Post might also discuss digital marketing. Instead of creating another Category for “Digital Marketing” content, you can tag the post using the phrase “digital marketing”. You can include more than 1 tag per Post, ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C77U612&location=852))
- Many websites will rely on just using pages as there is no need for new daily, weekly, or monthly content; however, more and more businesses are utilizing a blog and creating these blog Posts to describe recent events, testimonials, special sale periods, and much more.
