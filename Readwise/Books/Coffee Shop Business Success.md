- You can coordinate your uniform with any other form of advertising you decide to take out. This works particularly with your color. A combination of colors is instantly recognizable and promotes good memory recall. •     The use of a running theme as a constant reminder of your business is also beneficial. Select your uniform, the colors, the car decorations, the advertising in newspapers and magazines, the memento or business card-and make them all the same. •     Two very powerful tools are visual image and color. Both are easily retained in people's memory. Make good use of this fact. Find a color choice or theme that you love, and stick with it. This will help all your customers-current and future-commit your shop to memory and then recall it when necessary. It also optimizes the cost-efficiency of your advertising dollar. In addition, the running theme will give your business a secure, corporate look, making your enterprise look strong, stable and established. •     Consider the style of your business. Find a uniform that suits your personality, is comfortable to move and work in, and suits your target audience and your style of business. Try a gimmick. Be creative. Or try a more executive look, by sticking with particular blocks of color. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00WPUZY22&location=458))
