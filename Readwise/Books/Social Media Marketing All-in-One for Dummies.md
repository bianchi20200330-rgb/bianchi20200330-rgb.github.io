- Leave space for retweets. Try to make all your tweets retweetable. Because you’re allowed only 140 characters, try typing no more than 120 characters so that others have room to retweet your tweets. If it’s too much work for them to edit your tweet to add their own commentary, they won’t do it. ([Location 7889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SZ634QI&location=7889))
- If you’re joining a Twitter chat, let your community know. When you participate in a Twitter chat, you generally have more tweets in your stream than usual.
