- Which is now summed up for you in 7 go-to moves: •  Sequence Settings - DSLR 1080p30 •  Workflow layout (project panel, timeline, effects panel, source window, finished product window) •  Syncing .mov files with .wav files. •  New Tittle - adding text •  Effects panel - transitions, filters, crop, vocal enhancer •  Export Frame - Grab a screen shot •  Overlaying Pictures ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BUF9FVS&location=741))

- The basic concept is an image you have designed with certain CTA elements that drive your audience to:   •  Go to your website •  Subscribe •  Sign up ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BUF9FVS&location=817))
- Watch more •  Like on Facebook •  Follow on Instagram •  Follow on Snapchat ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BUF9FVS&location=823))
- What you’ll both need: ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BUF9FVS&location=882))

- Set up your kitchen, in this case it’s your podcasting setup plus your video setup. Hit record on your camera and hit record on your audio and CLAP! Go through your content and deliver like a boss Bring your two files into Premiere and sync them up: To Sync Files: Select both .mov file and audio file by holding down SHIFT RIGHT CLICK and Select MERGE CLIPS… HIT AUDIO HIT REMOVE AUDIO FROM AV CLIP HIT OK   5. Add your intro, outro, music, branding add-ons etc.   The number one thing podcasters ask me about is adding pictures or screenshots •  Simply drag your desired image into the project area. •  Then drag that on top of the movie file in the timeline. •  Shrink the image down or up by double clicking it. •  Handles will appear on the corners. •  Hold down SHIFT to change the size, but not the ratio. •  You can also do this by going to the Effects Control, selecting the image in the timeline and twirling down the Motion tab. •  Play with the Position and Scale to get your desired size.   6. Make sure your audio and music (if you use any) doesn’t run into each other (where the music is louder than you talking) You can make sure your audio levels are copacetic by looking at the ‘Audio Meters’. If you don’t see the Audio Meters, you need to enable them. Go to WINDOW > HIT AUDIO METERS > OR Go to WINDOW > HIT AUDIO CLIP MIXER and see it in the control panel   7. Export your video. To Export Video: CLICK ON THE TIMELINE HIT FILE > HIT EXPORT > HIT MEDIA > Format H.264 > Preset YouTube1080p HD > HIT OUTPUT NAME > Rename it, Save to Desktop > HIT EXPORT   Time Saver Tip: To save time, after you export your video, delete the meat of your content and keep all the branding, music, etc. so that you can drag in your next episode when you’re ready. I don’t do this anymore, as I create something from scratch every time. But it is very useful to create a template for yourself.

But that’s a general statement.   What you’ll need: •  A Facebook Fan Page •  A Facebook Ad budget (since starting this strategy in Oct 2015 we’ve spent under $1000 but spent over $200) •  Content to post “daily” (not literally) ([Location 1141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01BUF9FVS&location=1141))
