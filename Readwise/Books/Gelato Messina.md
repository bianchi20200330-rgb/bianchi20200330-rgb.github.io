- Fat: This now comes from cream, which has a cleaner mouthfeel. Proteins: Now come from skim milk powder, which is much better suited to help with air incorporation and texture. Lecithin: Now comes from specialty stabilisers and emulsifiers specifically for gelato and ice cream production (lecithin is not a good emulsifier at subzero temperatures; more on this further on). So, today, we really only ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=195))
- stabilisers and emulsifiers used in gelato making. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=207))
- We can break these additives into two categories: stabilisers and emulsifiers. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=211))
- STABILISERS ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=212))
- Stabilisers thicken and absorb much of the water present in your recipe. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=215))
- EMULSIFIERS ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=219))
- These bind the fat particles to the water present in your gelato. Fat and water do not mix, so you need an emulsifier to help do the job. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=220))
- The other key difference is the amount of air that is incorporated in the freezing stage. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=255))
- While we are at it, we may as well work out how many kilojoules are in the Fior di Latte gelato. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=272))
- There are a few machines out there that will meet you half way (like a Pacojet or a Carpigiani ‘Freeze & Go’), but these guys are still expensive and unless you use them frequently, don’t warrant the expense. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=279))
- Gelato made at home should be made in small quantities and served soon after you’ve made it. PASTEURISATION Pasteurisation is the process where you mix all your ingredients and heat them to a specific temperature. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=284))
- The best way to use the pasteuriser is to put all the liquids in first and when it gets to about 40°C (104°F) on the way up, mix in all your powders. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=310))
- THE SECOND reason why we pasteurise is because it’s the best way of mixing all your ingredients. Making gelato ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=314))
- AGEING ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=323))
- batch freezers ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=333))
- Carpigiani Maestro; ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=334))
- But on the gelato front, the batch freezer’s job is to take your mix at 4°C (39°F) and churn it into gelato at a temperature of –6°C (21°F), within a 15-minute period. During this process, air is incorporated and a good gelato mix should be able to incorporate 25% to 40% air. It’s imperative that your gelato mix is capable of accepting this quantity of air because this will give your gelato a soft and smooth texture when frozen. You can work out the percentage of air (we call it ‘overrun’) by weighing your mix in a container (before churning), then subtracting the weight of the gelato that fits into that same container (after churning) and then dividing it by the weight of the gelato and multiplying by 100. FOR EXAMPLE: WEIGHT OF MIX (100 G/3½ OZ) – WEIGHT OF GELATO (80 G/2¾ OZ) = 20 G (¾ OZ) DIVIDE BY WEIGHT OF GELATO (80 G/2¾ OZ) THEN MULTIPLY BY 100 = 25% Batch freezers can take your gelato mix down to –6°C (21°F) within a short period of time; this means you will get smaller ice crystals forming.

- domestic machine takes much longer to churn, so place your mixture in the freezer for 20 minutes before churning, so the mix is as close to 0°C (32°F) as possible, and switch the machine on a few minutes beforehand to get it really cold. This could shave 10 minutes off your churn time, reducing the possibility of ice crystals forming. Don’t expect much aeration in these machines; 10% would be amazing, although not ideal. They don’t beat the mix fast enough and that’s why you need to eat home-made gelato within a few hours of making it. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=345))
- Batch freezers only reduce the temperature of your mixture to about –6°C (21°F); they can’t go lower than that because the beater simply could not cope with the harder mixture, so it is extracted when about 30% of the mix is still unfrozen. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=351))
- it needs to be hardened down to –11°C (12°F) to –14°C (7°F), depending on the sugar content, before it starts to get the structure you would expect of a gelato. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=354))
- This is why rapid freezing to either its serving temperature of about –12°C (10°F) or storage temperature of at least –18°C (0°F) is important (for domestic storage, you don’t want to go below –15°C/5°F or the gelato will be too hard for serving). The quicker this happens, the longer your gelato will keep its structure. Be mindful that if you get your gelato from ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=357))

- If you want your gelato to last longer, then you need to freeze it to –18°C (0°F) very quickly. You can use a normal storage freezer (or a domestic freezer) but they will take up to 8 hours to get the gelato to the desired –18°C (0°F). This would buy you a few days of storage and a few days of serving (at around –12°C/10°F). If you have the capability of blast freezing and can achieve –6°C (21°F) to –18°C (0°F) in under 2 hours, you can store the gelato for up to 3 weeks at –18°C (0°F) and then it will last a couple of days at a serving temperature of about –12°C (10°F).

- For those of you using these recipes for a restaurant, you may need to increase the dextrose by around 40% (e.g. use 50 g/1¼ oz in the following recipes). Why? As you now know, dextrose has high antifreezing properties, so by using more dextrose in your recipe, it will have a softer consistency at a lower temperature. Unlike gelaterias, most restaurants don’t have freezers set at –12°C (10°F) — they use normal freezers that hover around –18°C (0°F) — so having more dextrose in your mix will mean that at –18°C (0°F) the gelato will be a bit softer and therefore easier to plate up.

- you’re making a savoury gelato, or any weird concoction for that matter, please eat a full serve of it before putting it out for sale in your gelateria or ice cream parlour, or serving it up to your friends or family for dessert.

- I recommend Jersey cow milk for this recipe because it has a higher fat content than normal milk (about 4% rather than 3.5%), which gives the milk a certain fragrance. It’s ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JB7L9HQ&location=424))
