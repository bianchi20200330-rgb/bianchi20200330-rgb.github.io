- Events of the Far East have put forth evidence of the uselessness of interventions, frequent if pernicious, of Europe reforming a people.

- Men thought and believed that European civilization was a progressive one – in science, industry, manufacture, and armament – and that Asia had nothing to compare with it. Consequently, they assumed that Asia could never resist Europe, that European oppression could never be shaken off. Such was the idea prevailing thirty years ago.14 Japan’s ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=190))

- Europeans, and then Americans, would find that they had underestimated the Asian ability to assimilate modern ideas, techniques and institutions – the ‘secrets’ of Western power – and then to turn them against the West itself. They ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=203))

- Rather, it seeks to open up multiple perspectives on the past and the present, convinced that the assumptions of Western power – increasingly untenable – are no longer a reliable vantage point and may even be dangerously misleading. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=221))
- Europeans and Americans customarily see their countries and cultures as the source of modernity and are confirmed in their assumptions by the extraordinary spectacle of their culture’s universal diffusion:today every society, save some isolated tribal communities in Borneo or the Amazonian rainforests, seems at least partially Westernized, or aspiring towards a form of Western modernity. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=224))
- This book seeks to offer a broad view of how some of the most intelligent and sensitive people in the East responded to the encroachments of the West (both physical and intellectual) on their societies. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=230))
- These early modern Asians stand at the beginning of the process whereby ordinary resentment against the West and Western dominance, along with anxiety about internal weakness and decay, was transformed into mass nationalist and liberation movements and ambitious state-building programmes across Asia. Many other Asian thinkers and leaders also appear here. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=240))

- fear of the West and obsession with Muslim self-strengthening prepared the way for Atatürk and Nasser as well as Ayatollah Khomeini, and still animates the politics of Islamic societies. During their long and eventful lives the Asians discussed in the book manifested all of the three main responses to Western power: the reactionary conviction that if Asian people were truly faithful to their religious traditions, which were presumed to be superior to those of all other civilizations, they would be strong again; the moderate notion that only a few Western techniques were required by Asians whose traditions already provided a sound basis for culture and society; and the vigorous determination, embraced by radical secularists like Mao and Atatürk, that the entire old way of life had to be revolutionized in order to compete in the jungle-like conditions of the modern world.

- So while describing the general intellectual and political atmosphere in Asia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, I hope above all to retrace their wanderings in the byways of modern history and thought. For these men, though relatively unknown, helped make the world we live in, for better and for worse.

- In 1798, the British were locked into a fierce battle with one of their most wily Indian opponents, Tipu Sultan, an ally of France. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=278))
- He also made some noises – familiar to us after two centuries of imperial wars disguised as humanitarian interventions – about delivering the Egyptians from their despotic masters. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=291))
- Europe was to express, as the nineteenth century progressed, an idea of itself through its manifold achievements of technology, constitutional government, secular state and modern administration; and this idea, which emerged from the American and French revolutions and which seemed to place the West in the avant-garde of progress, would be increasingly hard to refute. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=359))
- Some of this cultural arrogance lingered in the eyewitness accounts of Napoleon’s conquest by ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti. The cleric generally found French practices distasteful, even barbaric: ‘It is their custom’, he wrote, ‘not to bury their dead but to toss them on garbage heaps like the corpses of dogs and beasts, or to throw them into the sea.’8 ‘Their women do not veil themselves and have no modesty … They [the French] have intercourse with any woman who pleases them and vice versa.’9 Al-Jabarti also mocked French hats, the European habit of peeing in public, and the use of toilet paper. He contemptuously dismissed Napoleon’s claim to be a protector of Islam, laughing at the bad Arabic grammar of the Frenchman’s proclamations, and he sniggered when the French failed to launch a hot-air balloon at one of their demonstrations of European scientific prowess. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=368))
- Jabarti’s limited experience of political institutions made him misunderstand French revolutionary ideals: ‘their term “liberty” means,’ he concluded too hastily, ‘that they are not slaves like the Mamluks’.10 He sensed the hostility to his own Islamic values in Napoleon’s claim that ‘all the people are equal in the eyes of God’.‘This is a lie, and ignorance, and stupidity,’ he thundered. ‘How can this be when God has made some superior to others?’11 ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=375))
- Jabarti was also struck by the efficiency and discipline of the French army, and he followed with great curiosity the electoral processes in the Divan that Napoleon had created, explaining to his Arab readers how members wrote their votes on strips of paper, and how majority opinion prevailed. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=388))
- was not entirely deaf to the lessons from Napoleon’s conquest: that the government in the world’s first modern nation-state did not merely collect taxes and tributes and maintain law and order; it could also raise a conscript army, equip well-trained personnel with modern weapons, and have democratic procedures in place to elect civilian leaders. Two centuries later, al-Jabarti seems to stand at the beginning of a long line of bewildered Asians: men accustomed to a divinely ordained dispensation, the mysterious workings of fate and the cyclical rise and fall of political fortunes, to whom the remarkable strength of small European nation-states would reveal that organized human energy and action, coupled with technology, amount to a power that could radically manipulate social and political environments. Resentfully dismissive at first of Europe, these men would eventually chafe at their own slothful and uncreative dynastic rulers and weak governments; and they would arrive at a similar conviction: that their societies needed to attain sufficient strength to meet the challenge of the West.

- Explaining why China had dropped out of world history, Hegel had pointed to its indifference to maritime exploration. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=481))
- The British East India Company hit upon an alternative mode of payment once it increased its stranglehold over the fertile agricultural lands of eastern India. It was opium, which grew luxuriantly and could be cheaply processed into smokable paste, speedily shipped to southern China and sold through middlemen at Canton to the Chinese masses. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=486))
- The export of opium exponentially increased revenues and quickly reduced Britain’s trade deficit with China; mass Chinese intoxication became central to British foreign policy. But the easy availability of the drug quickly created a problem of addiction in the country. In 1800, the Chinese forbade the import and production of opium; in 1813, they banned smoking altogether. Still, ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=489))
- The same moral appeal was also addressed to the Westerners, including a letter to Queen Victoria by Lin Zexu, the imperial commissioner at Canton. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=502))
- He urged the British monarch to eradicate the opium plant in Madras, Bombay, Patna and Benares and replace it with millet, barley and wheat. ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=509))
- Furthermore, in Britain’s expanding economy of the early nineteenth century, ‘free trade’ seemed as much a universal good, to be enforced through military means, as ‘democracy’ was to appear in modern times. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=518))

- Lord Macaulay dismissed Indian learning as risibly worthless, enjoining the British in India to create ‘a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinion, in morals, and in intellect’. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=647))
- They mostly watched helplessly as the British set up plantations, dug canals and laid roads, and turned India into a supplier of raw materials to, and exclusive market for, British industries. ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=651))
- Village industries, such as hand spinning, have been destroyed … and nothing has been substituted, as in other countries, for the crafts thus destroyed. Customs and currency have been so manipulated as to bring further burdens on the peasantry. British manufactured goods constitute the bulk of our imports. Customs duties betray partiality for British manufacturers, and revenue from them is not used to lessen the burden on the masses but for sustaining a highly extravagant administration. Still more arbitrary has been the manipulation of the exchange which has resulted in millions being drained away from the country … All administrative talent is killed and the masses have to be satisfied with petty village offices and clerkships … the system of education has torn us from our moorings. ([Location 655](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=655))
- Westerners in Asia were increasingly seen as engaging in a deliberate assault on indigenous ways of life. Native frustration and grievances were inevitably articulated through religion, which, as Marx shrewdly pointed out, was much more than a belief system: it was a ‘general theory of the world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in a popular form, its spiritualistic point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, its universal source of consolation and justification’.45 Native rage, quietly simmering, often erupted into violence: the Boxer Rising in China, the tribal disturbances in east-central India at the very end of the nineteenth century, the Mahdist revolt in Sudan, the Urabi revolt in Egypt in 1882 and the tobacco revolution in Iran in 1891 would signify the strength of unorganized anti-West xenophobia, often accompanied by a desperate desire to resurrect a fading or lost socio-cultural order.

- was impossible for the intelligence of these foreigners and their good planning and methodical ways not to prevail against the ignorance and self-effacement of India. At this time the world had assumed a new pattern of industrialized civilization, and this way was crying aloud to every nation. No one in India heard this proclamation and all were destroyed.53 ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=729))
- Required to fight at sea as well as on land, and to protect their slave plantations in the Caribbean, the British, for instance, developed the world’s most sophisticated naval technologies. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=755))
- There was also something else behind European dominance. Writing in 1855 to Arthur Gobineau (who first developed the theory of an ‘Aryan’ master race), ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=759))
- As Fukuzawa Yukichi observed in the 1870s: In commerce, the foreigners are rich and clever; the Japanese are poor and unused to the business. In courts of law, it so often happens that the Japanese people are condemned while the foreigners get around the law. In learning, we are obliged to learn from them. In finances, we must borrow capital from them. We would prefer to open our society to foreigners in gradual stages and move toward civilization at our own pace, but they insist on the principle of free trade and urge us to let them come into our island at once. In all things, in all projects, they take the lead and we are on the defensive. There hardly ever is an equal give and take.59 By 1900, a small white minority radiating out from Europe would come to control most of the world’s land surface, imposing the imperatives of a commercial economy and international trade on Asia’s mainly agrarian societies. Europeans backed by garrisons and gunboats could intervene in the affairs of any Asian country they wished to. They were free to transport millions of Asian labourers to far-off colonies (Indians to the Malay Peninsula, Chinese to Trinidad); exact the raw materials and commodities they needed for their industries from Asian economies; and flood local markets with their manufactured products. The peasant in his village and the market trader in his town were being forced to abandon a life defined by religion, family and tradition amid rumours of powerful white men with a strange god-on-a-cross who were reshaping the world – men who married moral aggressiveness with compact and coherent nation-states, the profit motive and superior weaponry, and made Asian societies seem lumberingly inept in every way, unable to match the power of Europe or unleash their own potential. As ([Location 775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=775))
- Many Muslims interpreted the loss of their territories to Christian Europeans in India, Africa and Central Asia as God’s punishment for their religious laxity. ([Location 790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=790))
- The Industrial Revolution and Europe’s demand for raw materials for its manufacturing industries not only thwarted industrialization in Asia; it also forced traditionally self-sufficient peasants across Asia to become rubber-tappers, tin-miners, coffee-growers and tea-pickers. In ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=799))

- This is why the European subordination of Asia was not merely economic and political and military. It was also intellectual and moral and spiritual: a completely different kind of conquest than had been witnessed before, which left its victims resentful but also envious of their conquerors and, ultimately, eager to be initiated into the mysteries of their seemingly near-magical power.

In many ways he had more in common with the Young Ottomans, who argued for self-strengthening without blind imitation of the West, and who insisted that the Koran itself sanctioned many of the values – individual freedom and dignity, justice, the use of reason, even patriotism – touted by Turkish high officials as ‘Western’.

- His expulsion from Egypt and the defeat of liberal hopes there seem to have convinced al-Afghani of the need for a new tack. He would still experiment with different modes of resistance, often seeking to exploit European rivalries, but he would now advocate nationalisms, religious-based rather than ethnic or secular, in different Muslim countries, and would also deploy such potent invocations as pan-Islamism and holy war.

- The big problem which all Asian leaders in diverse societies would face lay in finding a way of unifying disparate populations around shared ideals and goals. Was there a common Egyptian or Turkish identity that transcended all other religious and ethnic identities? It was hard to see, but for the moment the spirit of negative nationalism – of opposition to foreign aggressors under a shared banner – seemed to suffice.

- Trapped by Sultan Abdulhamid in Istanbul, al-Afghani finally admitted that the kind of political mobilization he was looking for was not going to be led by despots, enlightened or not. More drastic, and popular, revolutions from below were needed; and they needed to shatter the bases as well as the superstructures of oppression.

And what if the foundations of despotism remain untouched? What if external intervention and internal weakness cancel out the gains of mass nationalist mobilizations, and pro-Western despots either linger long or periodically emerge to power? A measure of the magnitude of al-Afghani’s self-appointed task is that the problems he dealt with remain as dauntingly intransigent as ever, and their ramifications now extend not only to the Muslim countries he travelled through but also to the rest of the world.

This made modern imperialism very different from the expansionism of tyrants like Alexander the Great or Genghis Khan, and posed a unique danger to peace.

People entering democratic politics tended to be third-rate; far too many American presidents had been mediocre and uninspiring. The best aspects of American democracy were to be found at the local level – the political institutions of states, towns and counties – and these were too particular to America to be adapted to China’s circumstances. Democracy itself was best built from the bottom up over a long period. It couldn’t be imposed through revolution, as the fragility of democracy in France and Latin America had proved. And even in America, the liberal democratic state had been achieved with much coercion, and now, as America assumed its place in the world, it faced the danger of overcentralization. Also, imperialism was becoming more acceptable in America, as its financial and industrial power grew. ([Location 3068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=3068))

- Liang felt keenly this ignominy. But he was discouraged to find that Chinese expatriate communities in America, though subject to racial discrimination and abuse, did not support his grand vision of a self-empowering Chinese people at home. In the midst of a democratic country with freedom of speech, the Chinese-Americans preferred clannish ways; they clung to tradition, and produced criminal gangs and mafia dons rather than representative parties and leaders.

- Very soon, the Comintern was helping establish communist parties in different parts of Asia, and Soviet advisers were to help train Chinese Nationalists as well as Communists. ([Location 3455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=3455))
- 1919, Marxism was being studied and debated in many Asian cities and towns where European traders and missionaries had set up Western-style educational institutions, but the Russian Revolution and its anti-imperialist attitudes were still not much known to educated natives.

([Location 3468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=3468))
- In asserting that America was fighting for a better world, President Wilson was trying to undercut Bolshevik claims that the war was a struggle among imperialist powers, with the victorious elites likely to share the spoils. He aimed to influence those Americans and Europeans who, growing tired of the endless war, appeared dangerously susceptible to Bolshevik propaganda.

- was, as Wilson himself stressed during his presidential campaign in 1912, full of ‘expanding’ industries, which ‘will burst their jackets if they cannot find a free outlet to the markets of the world’.17 Nevertheless, as Sarkar wrote in 1919, the United States ‘has not yet had the time and “preparedness” enough to display excessive land hunger or market-quest, or zeal for the exploitation of weaker peoples in extra-American territories’.18 America’s record in Latin America – Wilson’s imposition, for instance, of military protectorates upon Haiti and Nicaragua – was mostly unexamined by Asians.

- Indeed, Wilson, who presided over a serious erosion of civil liberties during the war at home, was no stranger to moral compromises in foreign policy. ([Location 3483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007QPEDP0&location=3483))
- His anti-imperialism rested on a fine distinction that colonized peoples could not recognize. He regarded European imperialism as a matter of physical occupation of far-off lands and spheres of influence, and deplored it as such.

- Wilson had little interest in persuading Britain and France to renounce their colonial possessions in Asia and Africa. Not that this was in any event possible. Wilson had his chance when in the spring of 1917 he first heard of the secret treaties that outlined how Britain, France, Japan and Italy would share whole empires among themselves after the war. He could have made American intervention in the war contingent upon the Allied powers cancelling their squalid arrangements. Instead, he pretended that the treaties did not exist, and even tried to prevent news of them being published in the United States after the Bolsheviks exposed them to the world.

- However, confronted with the American principle that ‘all men are created equal’, Lord Balfour, soon to be famous for his work on Palestine, flatly asserted his disbelief that ‘a man of Central Africa was created equal to a European’.26 In the end, Makino put the racial equality issue to a vote – and won. But President Wilson, in an act remembered for decades by Japanese nationalists, ruled that the majority vote was annulled by the fact that there were some strong objectors to the clause.
